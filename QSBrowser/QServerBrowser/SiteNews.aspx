4/1/2010 - So here's the new site design/look. It's pretty much just a concept right now as you can probably tell,
there really isn't much of a structure here, no logo, just ... stuff. </p> 


</p>
<p>11/23/2010 - Moved website to its own VPS hosted by the good people at www.grok-cloud.com. All stats have been reset, I changed the database from SqLite to MySql, and now the site is being hosted using Apache with the mod_mono module for the ASP.NET pages.  
</p>
<p>I still need to fix a few issues and improve performance (particularly the indexes on the database) but they will have to wait until after this thanksgiving weekend.</p>
